2 Abstract 16 
 17 
The magnesium and sodium sulfate attacks on Portlan d cement paste in the presence of applied electric fields were 18 
studied, and the mineralogical alterations were inv estigated by both experiments and thermodynamic mod eling. 19 
When an electric current flows out of the cement pa ste, the electric migration of ions induced sulfate  ingress and 20 
decalcification. Compared with the specimen exposed  to Na 2SO 4, that exposed to MgSO 4 for 28 d proceeded to a 21 
later degradation stage, which is characterized by the decomposition of ettringite, portlandite, and A Fm phases, and 22 
the formation of CaSO 4. Thermodynamic modeling indicates a neutralization  process induced by the electric 23 
migration of OH -, which is potentially responsible for the decompos ition of ettringite. When an electric current 24 
flows into the cement paste, the Mg 2+  and Na + showed different migration behavior. Mg 2+  was incorporated to form 25 
brucite and M-S-H–like products in a shallow area ( ~100 μm) on the surface of the specimen, whilst a part of  the 26 
Na + could be bonded to form Na-rich silica gel with th e other part penetrating through the specimen. By c oupling 27 
the pore solution chemistry obtained from thermodyn amic modeling with the Nernst-Planck equation, the migration 28 
behaviors of the ionic species (SO 42-, Mg 2+ , and Na +) were analyzed. 29

1 Introduction 35 
 36 
Cement-based materials are porous and consist of mu ltiple phases. The hydration products (solid phase)  form the 37 

=== Page 4 ===
3 skeleton of the pore structures, and the pore solut ion (aqueous phase) and air (gaseous phase) fill in side the pores. 38 
In a fully hydrated cement paste, the hydration pro ducts are approximately at equilibrium with the por e solution. 39 
However, this state will be affected by the ionic e xchange between the pore solution and the external environment. 40 
Such a process usually induces mineralogical altera tions and is described as a chemical attack. The at tack is 41 
affected by the type, rate, and direction of the io n exchange, as well as the chemical reactions that occur. 42 
 43 
The ingress of external sulfate will cause sulfate attack, which is one of the most widely recognized and 44 
well-studied chemical attacks. In Portland cement s ystems, sulfate attacks are usually characterized b y the 45 
formation of ettringite, and by the expansion, crac king, and strength loss thereafter [1-3]. Recent th eories relate the 46 
expansion to the crystallization pressure caused by  the formation of ettringite from oversaturated sol ution in small 47 
pores [4-6]. The crystals growing in confined pores , e.g., in the C-S-H gel, generate crystallization pressure and 48 
thus expansive stress [7,8], whilst those growing i n unrestrained pore spaces do not. Gypsum usually f orms at the 49 
late stage of sulfate attack. There was once a deba te on whether the formation of gypsum is a cause [9 -11] or an 50 
effect [12,13] of the expansion and cracking. Recen t studies proposed that the presence of gypsum indu ces a high 51 
supersaturation with respect to ettringite, and thu s a high crystallization pressure and more expansio n [2,14,15]. 52 
 53 
The type of cation that coincides with sulfate grea tly influences the degradation process. When the ca tion is Mg 2+ , 54 
surface erosion occurs in addition to expansion [15 -17]. This phenomenon is induced by the formation o f brucite 55 
and magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) [2,16], and is the most important characteristic to distinguish  magnesium 56 
sulfate attack from sodium sulfate attack. It was a lso reported that the co-existence of Na +, K +, and Ca 2+  can reduce 57 
surface erosion and expansion in the MgSO 4 attack [2,16]. When the sulfate is provided by an acidic environment, 58 
neutralization can take place in the pore solution,  and the Ca 2+  can diffuse towards the external environment due t o 59 

=== Page 5 ===
4 the concentration gradient. Under this circumstance , calcium leaching or decalcification will also occ ur together 60 
with the sulfate attack [18-20]. 61 
 62 
In most cases, the ionic exchange between cement-ba sed materials and the external environment is drive n by the 63 
concentration gradient, and this process is known a s diffusion. In certain field conditions, the expos ed surface of a 64 
structure is subjected to strong evaporation condit ions. The moisture gradient between the external en vironment 65 
and cement-based materials induces capillary suctio n, and the ionic species will be transported by adv ection [21]. 66 
Under an applied electric field, the ionic species in the pore solution can also migrate, which is kno wn as electric 67 
migration [22-24]. The transportation of ionic spec ies—their diffusion, advection, and electric migrat ion in 68 
cement-based materials is described by the Nernst-P lanck equation [22-25]. During the ionic transporta tion, 69 
chemical reactions can take place. For example, SO 42- can react with monosulfate to form ettringite [1,2 0,26]. This 70 
reaction impacts not only the mass transport of SO 42- but also the strength of Ca 2+  and AlO 2- by disturbing the 71 
equilibrium between the hydration products and the pore solution. In this respect, the concurrent chem ical reactions 72 
and ionic transportation both play significant role s in the ingress of sulfate. 73 
 74 
In some cases, cement-based materials are directly exposed to applied electric fields, e.g., the DC st ray current that 75 
is present in underground metro tunnels [27-29]. El ectric migration can accelerate the ingress of aggr essive ions 76 
from the external environment and remove the calciu m and alkali metals from the pore solution [30,31].  Electric 77 
fields are also applied in some modern concrete tec hniques, e.g., chloride extraction, realkalinizatio n, cathodic 78 
protection, and electrochemical deposit [32-35]. In  these techniques, certain types of ions are design ed to migrate, 79 
but the migrations of other ions have to be conside red because they may induce side effects [36]. Elec tric migration 80 
is also a useful tool for laboratory acceleration t ests, e.g., the  chloride ion penetration tests (ASTM C1202), calciu m 81 

=== Page 6 ===
5 leaching acceleration tests [37,38], etc. Recent st udies proposed that electric migration tests can be  potentially used 82 
in the acceleration of sulfate attacks [39-41]. How ever, a deeper understanding of the mineralogical a lterations and 83 
the degradation mechanism under such circumstances will be needed to evaluate the validity of this tec hnique. 84 
 85 
In a conventional sulfate attack caused by diffusio n, both the cations and anions in the external solu tion diffuse into 86 
the cement-based materials, while the ions in the p ore solution, e.g. Ca 2+ , OH -, and alkali metal ions diffuse 87 
outward. In contrast, under applied electric fields , the cations and anions migrate in different direc tions, and thus 88 
the degradation behavior and mechanism may differ f rom the diffusion-induced sulfate attacks. This pap er studies 89 
the MgSO 4 and Na 2SO 4 attacks on Portland cement paste in the presence o f applied electric fields. The chemical 90 
and mineralogical alterations during the degradatio n process were analyzed by scanning electron micros copy 91 
(SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and thermogravimetric a nalysis 92 
(TGA). The results suggest different degradation be haviors between the areas near the cathode and anod e, and 93 
between the specimens exposed to different sulfate sources. To better understand the degradation mecha nism, an 94 
approach was proposed to simplify the electric migr ation processes, and changes of the phase assemblag es during 95 
the simplified electric migration processes were th en calculated by thermodynamic modeling. By combini ng the 96 
pore solution chemistry obtained in the thermodynam ic modeling with the Nernst-Planck equation, the mi gration 97 
behaviors of various ionic species were analyzed to  explain the different degradation behaviors observ ed 98 
experimentally. 99

The chemical composition of the Portland cement was  tested by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), a nd the 105 
mineralogical composition was measured by XRD and a nalyzed by Rietveld refinement, as shown in Table 1 . The 106 
specimens were cast into cylindrical molds that wer e 100 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height, cured at 20 °C ± 107 
1 °C, RH > 95% and unmolded after 24 h. The top of the cylinders, which was not in contact with the mo lds, was 108 
polished by P240 (58 μm) sandpaper to make it flat and smooth. The specim ens were then cured in saturated 109 
limewater at 20 °C ± 1 °C until 28 d. 110

 115 
The electric field was applied by electrolytic cell s similar to those for the chloride ion penetration  tests described in 116 
ASTM C1202 (Fig. 1a). The anode was a titanium mesh , and the cathode was a copper mesh. A constant ele ctric 117 

=== Page 8 ===
7 current of 30.0 mA (equal to ~4.71 A/m 2) was maintained by a DC power supply. The cells on  both sides were 118 
filled with the same sulfate solution, either 0.5 m ol/L MgSO 4 or 0.5 mol/L Na 2SO 4. This concentration is slightly 119 
higher than the one used in the sulfate expansion t ests in ASTM C1012 (5% Na 2SO 4, ~0.35 mol/L). The solutions 120 
were prepared using deionized water and sodium sulf ate anhydrous (Sinopharm, purity > 99.0%) or magnes ium 121 
sulfate heptahydrate (Sinopharm, purity > 99.0%), a nd were refreshed every three days. An estimation b ased on 122 
charge conservation shows that the concentration of  the sulfate solutions can remain higher than ~0.34  mol/L 123 
during the experiment (see Supplementary Data). For  either MgSO 4 or Na 2SO 4, three sets of electrolytic cells were 124 
set up. The specimens were taken out after exposure  to the applied electric fields for 7, 14, and 28 d ays. The 125 
deposits formed on the electrodes were cleaned ever y six days.  126

electric migration. The ionic species in the extern al solution (SO 42- and Na +/Mg 2+ ) diffuse towards the specimen on 138 
both sides, and the ions in the pore solution also diffuse towards the external solutions. 139 
 140 
Similar test setups are also used in [39-41] for ac celerating sulfate attacks in the laboratory. The c urrent density was 141 
not reported in those literatures, and the estimate d values were between one and several A/m 2 based on the voltage 142 
and size of the specimen (assuming the resistivity of water-saturated cement mortar is around 10 k Ω·cm). For 143 
studying the effects of DC stray current on reinfor cement corrosion and concrete degradation, the curr ent densities 144 
of 1 and 10 A/m 2 were chosen in [27,42]. The current density used i n this paper (~4.71 A/m 2) is comparable to 145 
these reported values. 146 
 147 
2.3 Test method 148 
 149 
After the exposures to the applied electric fields for certain durations, the specimens were removed f rom the test 150 
setups and cut into pieces according to the procedu res in Fig. 2. Small patches that contain all the d epth from the 151 
exposure surface (0 mm) to ~25 mm were prepared for  SEM. A face perpendicular to the exposure surface was 152 
used for observation. These samples were impregnate d with epoxy resin, polished on SiC discs and diamo nd 153 
suspension-sprayed discs (Buehler), carbon-coated, and observed using a Quanta 200 FEG microscope in t he 154 
backscattered electron mode. The hydration products  on the surface of the specimens usually showed cle ar features 155 
(brightness and morphology), and the chemical compo sition of such well-resolved hydration products was  analyzed 156 
based on at least five EDS measurements. EDS point analyses were also conducted randomly in the well h ydrated 157 
areas (where the hydration products mingle and cann ot be identified easily) to reflect the chemical co mposition of 158 

=== Page 10 ===
9 the hydration products in such areas. The average c hemical composition in several 50 μm × 50 μm areas was 159 
measured to represent the distribution of elements along the depth from the exposure surface. The micr ostructure 160 
were analyzed by observing a 5-mm-wide area paralle l to the surface. 161

solutions were cut off, (b) small patches that were  perpendicular to the exposure surface was cut for SEM, (c) the 165 
surface part (0.5 mm) of the remainder was removed,  (d) the specimen was cut parallel to the exposure surface into 166 
5-mm thick slices, and (e) the slices were crushed into powders (particle size <75 μm) for XRD and TGA. 167 
 168 
The powder samples for XRD and TGA were soaked in e thanol for 5 days to stop the hydration and then dr ied at 169 
40 °C for 24 h. XRD was conducted on a D/max2550VB3 +/PC diffractometer equipped with Cu K α1 radiation and 170 
a graphite monochromator. The X-ray generator was o perated at 40 kV and 250 mA, the scanning range was  2 θ = 171 
5–75°, and the step size and counting time were 0.0 2° and 2 s, respectively. TGA was conducted on a NE TZSCH 172 
STA 449C simultaneous thermal analyzer. The samples  were heated under N 2 atmosphere from 40 °C to 950 °C 173 
with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The data were exp ressed as differential thermogravimetry, and the pe aks were 174 
assigned according to [43]. Note that the specimens  for XRD and TGA did not include the surface part ( ~0.5 mm), 175 
because this part was quite different in compositio n from the other parts according to SEM but its mat erial amount 176 
was not sufficient for these tests. 177

 180 
Corundum ( α-Al 2O3, Aladdin, purity > 99.99%) was used as an internal  standard. It was mixed with the dried 181 
powder samples at a mass ratio of 10 to 90. The Rie tveld refinement was conducted using TOPAS Academic  V5. 182 
The crystallographic models were obtained from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), see 183 
Supplementary Data. The optimized parameters includ ed the background coefficient, zero-shift error, cr ystal size L, 184 
and lattice parameters (restrained within ± 0.5%). The peak shape was described by the fundamental par ameter (FP) 185 
approach employed in TOPAS. The March-Dollase ellip soidal preferred orientation correction algorithm [ 44] was 186 
employed for Alite-M3 (606) [45], portlandite (001)  [46], and calcite (104) [45]. Two peaks using fund amental 187 
parameters were added near 2 θ = 29.3° and 50.0° to simulate the broad peaks prod uced by C-S-H [47,48]; and the 188 
scale factor, crystal size L, and position of the p eaks were refined. 189

2.5 Simplifications in the thermodynamic modeling o f the degradation process 191 
 192 
In order to gain insight into the chemical and mine ralogical aspects of the degradation process and st udy the 193 
degradation mechanism, a simplified approach was pr oposed to represent the main processes of electric migration. 194 
Based on this simplified approach, the phase assemb lage during degradation was further studied by ther modynamic 195 
modeling. Here, electric migration is assumed to be  the only driving force for the ionic motion and de scribed by the 196 
Nernst-Planck equation [22-25] as 197

When an electric field is applied, the migration ra te of an ion depends on its charge number, concentr ation, and 205 
diffusion coefficient in free water. The diffusion coefficient in free water can be obtained from the chemistry 206 
handbook [49], and the concentration of ions in the  cement paste before exposure to electric fields ca n be calculated 207 
by thermodynamic modeling (see Supplementary Data),  as shown in Table 2. 208

As illustrated in Fig. 1b, it is assumed that each specimen contains two degradation areas that are lo cated on the 213 
exposure surfaces and are affected by the chemical attack, while the inner part between these two degr adation areas 214 
is not affected. At the beginning of degradation, t he pore solution chemistry and pore structure are s imilar in all 215 

=== Page 13 ===
12 parts across the cement paste, and the electric gra dient is uniform. In the pore solution, ionic speci es i at different 216 
positions will migrate at the same rate according t o Eq. 1. In the degradation area near the cathode, the cations are 217 
released into the cathodic solution due to electric  migration, but they are also supplemented by those  migrating 218 
from the inner part of the specimen at the same rat e. The anions in the pore solution migrate towards the inner part 219 
and are replaced by those from the cathodic solutio n. However, the migration rate of the anions from t he cathodic 220 
solution into the cement paste is difficult to dete rmine, because the electric gradient and pore struc ture are different 221 
between the surface of a specimen and its interior.  Here, it is assumed that the replacement of the an ions in the 222 
degradation area near the cathode maintains the cha rge balance. Similarly, the main process in the deg radation area 223 
near the anode is the replacement of cations in the  pore solution by those from the anodic solution in  a 224 
charge-balanced manner. These processes are similar  to those reported in numerical simulation studies of the rapid 225 
chloride migration test [23,50]. Here, they are def ined as the “basic state” of electric migration, wh ich is a transient 226 
state when the concentration of the ions in the por e solution is similar to that before degradation in itiates. The 227 
duration of the basic state depends on whether the concentration of the ionic species in the pore solu tion remains 228 
stable during the ionic exchange and the relevant c hemical reactions. 229 
 230 
In the pore solution, the concentration of OH - is higher than the other anions by three orders of  magnitude (Table 2), 231 
and the main anion in the cathodic solution (a neut ral Na 2SO 4 or MgSO 4 solution) is SO 42-. According to Eq. 1, 232 
these two ionic species migrate much faster than th e others in the pore solution and the cathodic solu tion, 233 
respectively. Moreover, the decomposition of portla ndite can somewhat help maintain the ionic strength  of OH - in 234 
the pore solution, which is known as the buffering effect [51]. Therefore, the electric migration proc ess near the 235 
cathode is simplified to the replacement of each tw o moles of OH - by one mole of SO 42-. 236 
 237 

=== Page 14 ===
13 In the area near the anode, K + and Na + are the most easily migrated ionic species. Howeve r, they will be removed 238 
quickly due to their low contents in the hydrated c ement paste [23,50], indicating that this state is short-lived. 239 
Afterward, Ca 2+  will be the main ionic species to migrate. (CaOH + will also migrate, but its effect on the 240 
mineralogical alteration is similar to that of Ca 2+ .) Its ionic strength can be maintained by the buff ering effect, 241 
suggesting a possibly longer duration. Therefore, t he electric migration process in this state is simp lified by 242 
replacing each mole of Ca 2+  with one mole of Mg 2+  or two moles of Na +, based on a hydrated system without K 243 
and Na. 244 
 245 
2.6 Thermodynamic modeling 246 
 247 
Thermodynamic modeling was performed using the geoc hemical code GEMS 3.3 [52] with the  Nagra/PSI database 248 
[53] and CEMDATA 18 database (version 18.01) [54]. The CSHQ model was selected. The solid solutions of  AFt 249 
and AFm were not considered. Siliceous hydrogarnet (C 3AS 0.8 H4.4 ) and thaumasite usually form at slow kinetics at 250 
the ambient temperature [55,56]. The presence of el ectric fields does not significantly impact the slo w formation 251 
kinetics of thaumasite [57], but it remains unknown  whether the formation kinetics of C 3AS 0.8 H4.4  will be 252 
influenced. These products were both suppressed in the modeling. 253 
 254 
First, the phase assemblage before sulfate ingress was calculated. The following hydration degrees wer e assumed 255 
based on the XRD results at an age of 28 d: 95% for  C 3S, 65% for C 2S, 100% for C 3A, and 70% for C 4AF. The 256 
Na 2O and K 2O in the cement were assumed to dissolve completely , while the MgO was assumed to dissolve by 257 
90%. Calcite was set to react freely [58]. 258 
 259 

=== Page 15 ===
14 The hydration phase assemblage during the electric migration process was then calculated by changing t he input 260 
recipe according to the simplified approach (see Su pplementary Data). In order to further analyze the migration rate 261 
of the ionic species in the pore solution during de gradation, the theoretical flux of OH - in the pore solution at the 262 
beginning of degradation was considered as a refere nce. Provided that the pore structure in Eq. 2 does  not change 263 
significantly during degradation, the relative flux  (R) of a type of ionic species i is hereby defined as 264 
=,
 ,=

 
   (3) 
 265 
At a given time during the electric migration proce ss, an ion with higher relative flux migrates faste r, provided that 266 
the flux is uniform in the cross-section. In additi on to their migration, the concentration of ions in  the pore solution 267 
may also be affected by the phase changes induced b y electric migration, and the manner of ionic migra tion may 268 
thus deviate from the description of the simplified  processes. This effect can also be represented by the changes in 269 
the relative flux. 270

3 Results 272 
3.1 Test results of MgSO 4 exposure 273 
3.1.1 Chemical composition and microstructural alte rations 274 
 275 
Near the cathode, an exposure to MgSO 4 in the presence of applied electric fields increas ed the S content of the 276 
cement paste (Fig. 3, see from the left). The S con tent near the surface (e.g., 0.1–10 mm) increased w ith the 277 
exposure time and became higher than that of the in side part (e.g., 20 mm). In addition, the Ca conten t near the 278 
surface decreased whilst the Si and Al contents inc reased. An enrichment of Mg was observed at a depth  of 0.1– 279 
0.25 mm after an exposure time of 28 d (Fig. 3b). I n addition to the chemical composition alteration, the surface 280 

=== Page 16 ===
15 area near the cathode (0–3 mm) showed a layered mic rostructure (Fig. 4a). In the outermost layer (0–30 0 μm, area 281 
I), a large amount of CaSO 4 formed on the surface of the specimen, and the hyd ration products decalcified to form 282 
silica-alumina gel (e.g., Spot A of Fig. 4b). Deepe r inside the cement paste (300–1000 μm, area II), the hydration 283 
products were affected by both decalcification and magnesium ingress. The silica-alumina gel showed a high Mg 284 
content (Spot A of Fig. 4c), which agrees with the Mg enrichment in this area (Fig. 3b). CaSO 4 was also present in 285 
this area (Spot B of Fig. 4c). About 1–3 mm from th e surface (area III), the hydration products were n ot impacted 286 
by the ingress of either magnesium or sulfate. The cement paste was porous (Fig. 4d). The Ca/Si ratio of the 287 
hydration products in this area was typically small er than 1.5, which coincides with the chemical comp osition 288 
shown in Fig. 3b. From 3 mm inside (area IV), the c ement paste started to show continuous alterations without 289 
layered structures. 290

The cement paste near the anode did not show signif icant alterations on both chemical composition (Fig . 3, see 303 
from the right) and microstructure (Fig. 5). A very  small increase of the S content was observed in th e surface area 304 
(0.1 mm from the surface). Considering the directio n of electric migration (Fig. 1b), the increased S content is 305 
mainly induced by diffusion [39,40]. The Mg 2+  in the anodic solution should theoretically move t owards the cement 306 
paste due to electric migration (Fig. 1b). However,  the ingress of Mg 2+  was constrained within a depth of ~100 μm 307 
according to SEM. (Fig. 5). This 100- μm-zone was rich in CaSO 4, and two types of Mg-containing products with 308 
different brightness and Mg/Si ratio were found. Cl oser to the surface, some Mg-containing products in  clusters 309 
were embedded in the CaSO 4. These products were darker than the hydration pro ducts nearby. The Mg/Si ratio was 310

17 higher than 3 (Spot A), which potentially indicates  a mixture of M-S-H and brucite on the microscale. Similar 311 
products were also reported to form on the surface of the cement mortar after the magnesium sulfate at tack in the 312 
absence of applied electric fields [15,16]. Farther  from the exposure surface, there were some larger particles (Spot 313 
B). Compared with the Mg-containing products in clu sters (Spot A), the Mg/Si ratio of these particles was much 314 
lower, and the Ca content was higher. This chemical  composition led to a slightly higher brightness an d may 315 
represent a mixture of M-S-H and C-S-H, or an M-C-S -H [59]. Next to the CaSO 4-rich zone, the Ca/Si ratio of the 316 
hydration products was typically higher than 1.5, a nd no magnesium-containing products were observed, which is 317 
also verified in Fig. 3b. 318

After an exposure time of 7 d (Fig. 6a), the chemic al composition of the hydration products indicates the presence 325 
of CaSO 4 and ettringite at the depths of 0.5 mm and 5 mm fr om the cathode. A small amount of ettringite may ex ist 326 
at the depth of 15 mm. After an exposure time of 28  d (Fig. 6b), the hydration products at 2 mm from t he cathode 327 
(area III, Fig. 4a) showed very small S/Ca and rela tively high Al/Ca to the other groups, coinciding w ith the 328

from the cathode (area IV, Fig. 4a), and a large am ount of CaSO 4 with ettringite in a minor proportion may be 330 
paresnt at 15 mm from the cathode. In the areas tha t are 0.5 mm, 5 mm, and 15 mm from the anode (Fig. 6c), the 331 
hydration products may contain a mixture of ettring ite, monosulfate, C-S-H, and portlandite. 332

3.1.2 Mineralogical alteration 340 
 341 
In the cement paste near the cathode, the formation  of sulfate-bearing products and decomposition of p ortlandite 342 
were observed. After 28 d exposure to MgSO 4, the cement paste nearest to the surface (0.5–5 mm ) contained almost 343 
no portlandite or ettringite, but a large amount of  CaSO 4 (Fig. 7a, see from the left). The CaSO 4 content was 344 
slightly higher at 5–10 mm than that of the surface  part, and started to decrease beyond this depth. P ortlandite and 345 
ettringite were detected beyond the depth of 10 mm,  and their contents increased with the depth. In ad dition to the 346 
decomposition of portlandite, the amorphous content  in the cement paste near the cathode also showed a  reduction. 347 
Fig. 7b shows that the formation of ettringite and CaSO 4 started even before 7 d, during which the decompos ition 348 
of portlandite had been significant. Between 7–14 d , the formation of CaSO 4 continued while ettringite started to 349 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0

19 decompose. Almost no portlandite could be detected by 14 d, and the CaSO 4 content remained almost constant 350 
afterward. Monocarbonate and hemicarbonate were obs erved due to the hydration of limestone [56,58]. Th ese 351 
products had formed before the exposure to MgSO 4 but started to decompose after the exposure. Almos t no AFm 352 
phases remained near the cathode after an exposure time of 7 d (Fig. 7b). Magnesium-bearing products w ere not 353 
observed in XRD, which agrees with the small penetr ation depth of Mg 2+  shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. However, 354 
brucite was observed to form in the cathodic soluti on, which mingles with other products and forms a t hick layer of 355 
deposits on the electrode. The deposits collected o n the 28th exposure day and tested by XRD suggested  a mixture 356 
of 40.2% brucite, 41.1% gypsum, 14.5% portlandite, 3.3% anhydrite, and 0.8% calcite. 357

20 contents of monocarbonate and hemicarbonate decreas ed (Fig. 7c). After 28 d, the ettringite content in  this area was 367 
slightly higher than that of the 5–10 mm area (Fig.  7a, see from the right). No other significant mine ralogical 368 
alterations could be observed in the 0.5–5 mm area,  which also agrees with the SEM observations (Fig. 3, Fig. 5, 369 
and Fig. 6c). The XRD analyses did not include the outer surface (~0.5 mm) and thus no Mg-bearing prod uct, e.g., 370 
brucite, was detected. No brucite deposits could be  found in the anodic solution, either. 371

3.2.1 Chemical composition and microstructural alte rations 376 
 377 
Near the cathode, an exposure to Na 2SO 4 in the presence of applied electric fields also in duced an increased S 378 
content (Fig. 8, see from the left), but to a much lower extent compared with the situation of the MgS O 4 exposure 379 
(Fig. 3). The S content in the 0.5–10 mm area after  28 d exposure to Na 2SO 4 (Fig. 8b) was even lower than that of 380 
the same area exposed to MgSO 4 for 7 d (Fig. 3a). Different from the situation of  MgSO 4 exposure, the loss of Ca 2+  381 
in this area could not be clearly observed. After a n exposure time of 28 d, the Ca content on the surf ace even 382 
showed a small increase (Fig. 8b). The microstructu re of the cement paste after the exposure to Na 2SO 4 showed 383 
different features compared with that of the MgSO 4 exposure. The cement paste in the 0–600 μm area was porous 384 
(Fig. 9a). Portlandite and large ettringite crystal s could be observed (Fig. 9b). A calcite shell cove red the surface of 385 
the specimen, and calcite could also be found insid e the cement paste. 386

 391 
The surface area near the anode (0.5 mm) showed sli ghtly higher S content compared with the areas insi de the 392 
specimen (Fig. 8, see from the right), which is sim ilar to the situation of MgSO 4 exposure. Different from Mg 2+  393 
whose penetration depth is less than 100 μm, Na + could penetrate deeper into the specimen from the anode, as 394 
indicated by its increased content at a depth of 5– 15 mm near the anode in Fig. 8a. There are two poss ible causes 395 
for the Na enrichment: a) a continuous accumulation  during seven days, or b) a quick accumulation duri ng the day 396 
before testing, after the sulfate solution was just  refreshed. When we chose not to refresh the soluti on on the 27th 397 
day, no Na enrichment was observed in the specimen on the 28th day (Fig. 8b). This observation support s the 398 
second hypothesis and indicates that the migration of Na + under electric fields was fast. The microstructure  of the 399 
surface area after Na 2SO 4 exposure showed some similar features compared wit h that of MgSO 4 exposure. A 400 
CaSO 4-rich zone also formed (Fig. 10a), and silica gel t hat is rich in Na can be observed (Spot A of Fig. 1 0b). 401 
Between the CaSO 4-rich zone and the cement paste, there is a Na-bear ing rim (Spot B of Fig. 10b). Comparing the 402 
chemical composition of the rim with that of the Na -rich silica gel, the former owned a slightly lower  Na content 403 
and a higher Ca content. Next to the CaSO 4-rich zone, the Ca/Si ratio of the hydration produc ts was also higher 404 
than 1.5. The Ca/Si ratio became stable beyond this  depth (~100 μm), as also verified in Fig. 8b. 405

ettringite was suggested to form at 0.5 mm, 5 mm, a nd 15 mm depths from the cathode (Fig. 11b), whilst  a small 417 
amount of ettringite may also be present at the 0.5  mm area from the anode (Fig. 11c). 418

 427 
When the specimen is exposed to Na 2SO 4, CaSO 4 did not form in large amounts near the cathode (e. g., 0.5–20 mm, 428 
Fig. 12a, see from the left) even after an exposure  time of 28 d. Instead, the ettringite content in t his area was high, 429 
and it decreased with the distance from the surface . Furthermore, the decomposition of portlandite and  AFm 430 
(especially monocarbonate and hemicarbonate) after Na 2SO 4 exposure was not as significant as the situations in the 431 
MgSO 4 exposure (comparing Fig. 12a to Fig. 7a). The deco mposition of portlandite and AFm, and the formation  of 432 
ettringite showed a positive relationship with time  (Fig. 12b). 433

In the surface area near the anode (0.5–5 mm), no s ignificant mineralogical alterations could be obser ved except for 442 
a small increase in the ettringite content and a de crease in the contents of monocarbonate and hemicar bonate. 443 
Similar to the situation of MgSO 4 exposure, these phenomena are assigned to the effe cts of SO 42- diffusing from the 444 
anodic solution (Fig. 12c). The Na enrichment after  7 d exposure to Na 2SO 4 did not form any products that can be 445 
detected by XRD. Moreover, no deposits formed in th e cathodic and anodic solutions. 446

The phase assemblage and pore solution chemistry du ring the simplified electric migration processes we re 452 
calculated by thermodynamic modeling. For the elect ric migration near the cathode (Fig. 13a), SO 42- initially 453 
stabilized ettringite in favor of monocarbonate. Af ter the complete consumption of monocarbonate, gyps um was 454 
stabilized in favor of portlandite and C-S-H. Durin g these processes, the SO 42- concentration in the pore solution 455 
showed an increase, whilst the OH - concentration kept decreasing (Fig. 13b). In addit ion to gypsum, amorphous 456 0510 15 20 25

 472 
In the anode area exposed to MgSO 4 (Fig. 13c), the incorporated Mg 2+  stabilized hydrotalcite and ettringite in favor 473 
of monocarbonate at an initial stage. Brucite forme d when all the monocarbonate was consumed, during w hich 474 
portlandite decomposed. At the last stage of the el ectric migration process, M-S-H and gypsum were sta bilized in 475 
favor of C-S-H and ettringite, respectively. In con trast, exposure to Na 2SO 4 induced continuous Na uptake in the 476 
C-S-H (Fig. 13e). By separating the Na end-member f rom the C-S-H phase in the CSHQ model, the Na uptak e can 477 
be clearly observed. Portlandite kept stable until the depletion of C-S-H. Ettringite and monocarbonat e were 478 
predicted to destabilize during the electric migrat ion process. 479 
 480 
3.3.2 Migration of ionic species 481 
 482 
The simplified electric migration process assumes t hat the phase changes are restricted in a certain “ degradation 483 
area” on the surface of a specimen (see Fig. 1b). T he relative flux of a certain ion is thus interpret ed as its migration 484 
rate from the degradation area towards a certain di rection which depends on the ion’s polarity. In the  degradation 485 
area near the cathode, when degradation initiated O H - had the highest relative flux among all the ionic species (Fig. 486 
14a). This phenomenon demonstrates that the replace ment of OH - by SO 42- from the external solution was the most 487 
significant process that occurred. The relative flu x of SO 42- turned higher when all the monocarbonate decompose d 488 
(point A), and exceeded that of OH - when portlandite started to decompose and gypsum s tarted to form (point B). 489 
From this point on, SO 42- would take the place of OH - as the main ionic species that migrated towards th e inner part 490 
of the specimen. The replacement of OH - by SO 42- in the degradation area, represented by the relati ve flux of OH -, 491 

=== Page 28 ===
27 thus slowed down, and the degradation remained stab le at point B. During the degradation process, the relative flux 492 
of Ca 2+  showed an increase (point A), indicating that the loss of Ca 2+  from the degradation area to the external 493 
solution will be faster than the compensation from the inner part of the specimen. 494

compensated by those from the inner part of the spe cimen, and the compensation rate is marked by a dia mond 501 
(provided that the ionic strength in the inner part  of the specimen remains stable). The square bracke t indicates the 502 
ionic species in the external solution is transport ed into the degradation area with the same relative  flux to certain 503 
ions based on the assumption of charge balance. 504 
 505 
For the anode area that is exposed to MgSO 4 (Fig. 14b), the relative flux of OH - remained the highest for a long 506 
period during the electric migration process. This phenomenon indicates that the outflow of OH - to the external 507 1.E-07 1.E-05 1.E-03 1.E-01 1.E+01

28 solution, as well as the compensation of OH - from the inner part, was faster than the migration  of all the other ions. 508 
The relative flux of Ca 2+  was at a lower level, indicating that the Ca 2+  in the degradation area would be replaced by 509 
the Mg 2+  from the external solution at a slow rate. The rel ative flux of Mg 2+  was even lower than that of Ca 2+ , 510 
indicating that the Mg 2+  in the degradation area could hardly migrate towar ds the inner part. The relative flux of 511 
SO 42- showed an increase during the electric migration p rocess (point A). This phenomenon will theoreticall y lead 512 
to a loss of SO 42- in the degradation area, but this effect may be of fset by the diffusion of SO 42- from the external 513 
solution in the experiments. At the last degradatio n stage (point B), the relative flux of Mg 2+  increased sharply, the 514 
penetration of Mg 2+  started, and the entire electric migration process  repeated stepwise in a slightly deeper area 515 
from the surface. The degradation phase assemblage thus kept stable at point B. 516 
 517 
When the anode was exposed to Na 2SO 4 (Fig. 14c), the relative flux of OH - remained the highest among all the 518 
ionic species during the entire electric migration process. The relative flux of Na + was lower than that of OH -, but 519 
much higher than that of Mg 2+  in the specimen exposed to MgSO 4. This phenomenon indicates that Na + will 520 
migrate into the cement paste at a much higher rate  than Mg 2+ . The relative flux of Ca 2+  was at a low level during 521 
the electric migration process, suggesting that the  replacement of Ca 2+  by Na + in the degradation area will be slow, 522 
and most Na + will migrate towards the inner part of the specime n. 523 
 524 
4 Discussions 525 
4.1 Comparison between test results and thermodynam ic modeling 526 
 527 
The mineralogical alterations that occurred near th e cathode agreed well with the thermodynamic modeli ng, as 528 
indicated by the arrows in Fig. 13a. After exposure  to MgSO 4 for 28 d, CaSO 4 was observed to form in the outer 529 

=== Page 30 ===
29 part of the specimen (0–10 mm) where almost no port landite or ettringite existed (XRD, Fig. 7a). The 530 
silica-alumina gel found on the surface of the spec imen (SEM, Fig. 4b) corresponds to the amorphous Si O 2 and 531 
AH 3 in the thermodynamic modeling [14], and the reduct ion of the amorphous content coincides with the 532 
decomposition of C-S-H predicted by thermodynamic m odeling. Deeper inside the specimen (10–40 mm), the  533 
content of CaSO 4 gradually decreased, while those of portlandite an d ettringite increased (XRD, Fig. 7a). In 534 
comparison, the specimen exposed to Na 2SO 4 for 28 d remained at an earlier degradation stage,  when CaSO 4 did 535 
not form in large amounts. The different degradatio n stages between the specimens also coincide with t he amount 536 
of S that has been transported from the cathodic so lution into the cement paste (EDS, cf. Fig. 3b and Fig. 8b). 537 
 538 
The mineralogical alterations occurred in a shallow  depth (~0.1 mm) in the cement paste near the anode , but had 539 
proceeded to the last degradation stage in both exp osure conditions when comparing the test results wi th the 540 
thermodynamic modeling (Fig. 13c and 13e). For the MgSO 4 exposure, the presence of Mg-containing products 541 
(brucite and M-S-H, SEM, Fig. 5) agrees with the th ermodynamic calculation, while for the Na 2SO 4 exposure, the 542 
Na-rich silica gel (Fig. 10) coincides with the Na uptake by C-S-H in the thermodynamic modeling. A Ca SO 4-rich 543 
zone was observed in both exposure conditions no ma tter if CaSO 4 is predicted to be stable. The diffusion of SO 42- 544 
from the anodic solution is believed to be responsi ble for this phenomenon (see also Fig. 1b). 545 
 546 
4.2 Migration behavior of Mg 2+ , Na +, and SO 42- 547 
 548 
The degradation near the cathode and anode proceede d in different ways. Near the cathode, the anions f rom the 549 
external solution (mainly SO 42-) migrated into a deep area, and the mineralogical alteration proceeded gradually 550 
following the prediction of thermodynamic modeling.  For the anode area exposed to MgSO 4, the incorporation of 551 

=== Page 31 ===
30 Mg 2+  occurred in a shallow area with the mineralogical alteration proceeding directly to the late degradat ion stage. 552 
In contrast, Na + could penetrate deep into the cement paste, but th e mineralogical alteration occurred also in a 553 
shallow area. The different migration behaviors of the ionic species can be explained by the relative flux which is 554 
obtained from the solution chemistry calculated by thermodynamic modeling. 555 
 556 
According to section 3.3.2, an ion’s capability for  migration under electric fields depends on its rel ative flux, while 557 
its accumulation rate in a degradation area depends  on the relative flux of the other ion that is bein g replaced. For 558 
the degradation process near the cathode, the high relative flux of OH - suggests a fast accumulation of SO 42- at an 559 
early degradation stage, whilst the increased relat ive flux of SO 42- indicates an accelerated migration rate towards 560 
the inner part of the specimen (Fig. 14a). In contr ast, for the degradation process near the anode, th e smaller 561 
relative flux of Ca 2+  than that of OH - suggests a slower accumulation rate of the cations  (Mg 2+  or Na +) than the 562 
outflow of OH - (Fig. 14b and 14c), which coincides with the shall ow depth of Mg 2+  and Na + incorporation (Fig. 5 563 
and 10). The strengths of Na + and Mg 2+  in the pore solution (Fig. 13d and 13f) and thus t heir relative fluxes (Fig. 564 
14b and 14c) were different after the chemical reac tions. As a result, Na + and Mg 2+  showed different migration 565 
behaviors (also compare Fig. 3 and Fig. 8). The dif ferent migration behaviors of SO 42- and Mg 2+  were once realized 566 
when using thermodynamic modeling to study the magn esium sulfate attack simply caused by diffusion [15 ,16]. It 567 
was reported that the penetration depth of Mg 2+  is usually overestimated compared to that of SO 42-. According to 568 
the findings in this paper, this can be explained b y the low concentration of Mg 2+  in the pore solution and thus its 569 
slower diffusion rate than SO 42-. 570 
 571 
The electric migration of the cations and anions ca n also influence each other because both processes carry electric 572 
charges. The experiment was conducted under a const ant electric current. The same amount of charges sh ould pass 573 

=== Page 32 ===
31 through the specimen during the same period of time , no matter the specimen was exposed to MgSO 4 or Na 2SO 4. In 574 
the cathode side, SO 42- was migrated from the cathodic solution into the c ement paste. It penetrated through the 575 
specimen together with OH - (and other anions) in the pore solution. In the me anwhile, the Ca 2+  in the pore solution 576 
were released into the cathodic solution, but this process carried less electric charges due to the lo w relative flux of 577 
Ca 2+  than the anions. In the anode side exposed to MgSO 4, the migration of Mg 2+  and Ca 2+  towards the inner part of 578 
the specimen were at low rates. The electric charge s were mainly carried by the OH - migrating from the inner part 579 
of the specimen towards the anode side, and finally  into the anodic solution. In contrast, in the case  of Na 2SO 4 580 
exposure, Na + could penetrate through the specimen much more eas ily than Mg 2+ , and its electric migration can 581 
carry much more electric charges. Under such circum stance, the electric migration of anions (SO 42- and OH -) will 582 
carry fewer charges, and thus the sulfate ingress w ill proceed on a lower rate compared with the situa tion of MgSO 4 583 
exposure. Similar results were also reported in [41 ] but no convincing explanations were ever given. 584 
 585 
4.3 Comparison with the sulfate attack induced by d iffusion 586 
 587 
To compare with the sulfate attack in the absence o f electric field (induced by diffusion), the main m ineralogical 588 
alterations of Portland cement (Type I with limesto ne addition) mortars under Na 2SO 4 and MgSO 4 attacks [11,15] 589 
and the results obtained in this paper are summariz ed in Table 3. This section focuses on the sulfate ingress and 590 
decalcification near the cathode because a) these e ffects influenced a much wider area than the phase alterations 591 
near the anode and b) similar processes also occur in the diffusion-induced sulfate attacks. 592 
 593 
In the diffusion-induced Na 2SO 4 attack, the ingress of sulfate leads to the format ion of ettringite followed by that of 594 
gypsum. In the MgSO 4 attack, nevertheless, Mg 2+  reacts with OH - in the pore solution to form brucite, reducing the  595 

=== Page 33 ===
32 solution pH to ~10.5 and inducing the decomposition  of ettringite [60,61]. The decomposition of ettrin gite was also 596 
observed here when the specimen is exposed to MgSO 4. This phenomenon can be also attributed to a reduc tion of 597 
the pore solution alkalinity, but the presence of M g 2+  may not be a decisive factor considering the shall ow depth of 598 
the Mg transportation (Fig. 3b). During the sulfate  ingress, the OH - in the pore solution near the cathode was 599 
theoretically transported towards the inner part of  the specimen by the electric field. This process i s used as a basic 600 
assumption in the thermodynamic modeling and it is shown that the decomposition of ettringite and the formation 601 
of gypsum occurred simultaneously with the decrease  of OH - concentration in the pore solution (Fig. 13b). 602 
According to the test results, the presence of CaSO 4 in the cement paste near the cathode (Fig. 7) indi cates 603 
sufficient ionic strengths of Ca 2+  and SO 42- for the stabilization of ettringite [2,14,15], whi lst the Al content in the 604 
hydration products did not show any apparent reduct ion (Fig. 3). It can be thus inferred that the deco mposition of 605 
ettringite was most probably caused by a neutraliza tion process as assumed in the thermodynamic modeli ng. A 606 
similar neutralization process was also observed wh en accelerating thaumasite sulfate attacks by appli ed electric 607 
fields, and this process was also believed to desta bilize ettringite according to [62]. 608

 615 
In the diffusion-induced sulfate attack, decalcific ation usually occurs on the surface of a specimen a nd is 616 

=== Page 34 ===
33 characterized by the decomposition of portlandite a nd the decrease of the Ca/Si in C-S-H [1,63,64]. In  the presence 617 
of bicarbonate, gypsum will be the only stable sulf ate-bearing product in the decalcification zone, an d amorphous 618 
SiO 2 and AH 3 are predicted as the stable phases by thermodynami c calculation [14,15]. Similar results are also 619 
obtained in this paper (e.g., the MgSO 4 exposure for 28 d), but a different mechanism can be proposed when the 620 
decalcification is induced by electric migration. A ccording to the thermodynamic modeling, the relativ e flux of 621 
Ca 2+  migrating from the cement paste to the external so lution accelerated during the degradation process ( Fig. 14a). 622 
This suggests that the loss of Ca 2+  in the cement paste near the cathode cannot be ful ly compensated by the Ca 2+  623 
migrating from the inner part of the specimen. The Ca 2+  content near the cathode decreased (Fig. 3 and 8),  thus 624 
leading to the decalcification and the decompositio n of hydration products. The decalcification near t he cathode 625 
may also have accelerated the transportation of Mg 2+  through diffusion (Fig. 3b and Fig. 4c), as also r eported in 626 
concrete exposed to field conditions [65,66]. But t he presence of Mg is not likely to be the cause of decalcification 627 
here considering the depths of these processes (Fig . 4, Area III showed decalcification but very small  Mg content). 628 
 629 
The Ca/Si ratio (cf. Fig. 3 and Fig. 8) and portlan dite content (cf. Fig. 7 and Fig. 12) indicate that  the specimen 630 
exposed to MgSO 4 had a higher degree of decalcification than that e xposed to Na 2SO 4. On one hand, the 631 
decalcification process is induced by the electric migration of Ca 2+ . It will be impacted by the electric migration of 632 
other cations (Mg 2+  and Na +), and thus the degree of decalcification coincides  with that of sulfate ingress. On the 633 
other hand, this process is also impacted by altera tions of ionic strength in the external sulfate sol ution near the 634 
cathode, which is a potential drawback of the test setup. When the specimen was exposed to Na 2SO 4, H + in the 635 
solution would be reduced to H 2 on the cathode, thus producing OH - in the solution [40] (Fig. 1b). Both OH - and 636 
SO 42- could carry electric charges and would migrate int o the cement paste near the cathode. The OH - migrating 637 
towards the specimen may react with the Ca 2+  that was driven out of the paste to form a surface  layer consisting of 638 

=== Page 35 ===
34 portlandite. When the Na 2SO 4 solution was refreshed (every 3 d), the portlandit e might carbonate, forming a calcite 639 
layer as observed in the SEM (Fig. 9). This hypothe sis explains the slight increase of the Ca content near the 640 
cathode area in Fig. 8b and a better protection fro m carbonation may help with its verification. In co ntrast, in the 641 
MgSO 4 solution, the OH - produced on the cathode precipitated with Mg 2+  to form brucite in the external solution 642 
(section 3.1.2). Owing to the precipitation of OH -, SO 42- was the main anion migrating into the specimen, an d thus 643 
CaSO 4 formed on the surface of the specimen instead of c alcite (Fig. 4b). 644 
 645 
4.4 Comparison with coupled reactive-transport mode ling 646 
 647 
As stated in [1], the coupled reactive-transport mo deling and the pure thermodynamic modeling presente d 648 
comparable results in revealing the phase alteratio ns of a diffusion-induced sulfate attack. The pure thermodynamic 649 
modeling is usually easy to use and provides fast r esults, but the results do not correspond directly with the real 650 
exposure time or the depth from the exposure surfac e. In comparison, coupled reactive-transport modeli ng provides 651 
the information of time and depth, but the accuracy  depends strongly on the preciseness of models (e.g ., 652 
transportation equation, fluid transport, charge ba lance) [21,67] and parameters (e.g., diffusion coef ficient) [1]. This 653 
paper proposed a simplified approach for the pure t hermodynamic modeling study of electric-migration-i nduced 654 
sulfate attacks. Such an approach focuses on the ch emical and mineralogical aspects and clarifies alte rations of the 655 
hydration products. Although the real distribution of the products was not presented, this information  can be 656 
reflected by the relative flux that is proposed her e. The advantages and validity of this approach wil l be further 657 
demonstrated in an upcoming paper investigating the  effect of supplementary cementitious materials in the same 658 
situation. 659

35 The thermodynamic modeling calculation conducted in  this paper is based on the assumption that the kin etics of the 661 
chemical reactions is much faster than the transpor tation of ionic species, and that the hydration sys tem is close to 662 
an equilibrium state. As reviewed in [68], this ass umption is usually valid  in most practical cases involving the 663 
diffusion of ions in saturated systems, and thus it  is widely accepted by the existing pure thermodyna mic modeling 664 
studies [1,2,11,14-16]. In contrast, electric migra tion usually induces a quicker ionic motion, and th us the 665 
equilibrium state is more difficult to be reached [ 24]. When studying the electric migration of chlori de by coupled 666 
reactive-transport models, an equilibrium state was  assumed in [69] and the test results agree well wi th the 667 
modeling. The results of this paper also show that the migration behavior of ionic species coincides w ith the 668 
solution chemistry (relative flux) under the assump tion of equilibrium. It can be thus inferred that t he real solution 669 
chemistry in the hydrated cement paste is similar t o that under the equilibrium state and that the equ ilibrium 670 
assumption is likely to be valid in the case of ele ctric migration. 671 
 672 
The electric migration behavior of ionic species ca n be represented by the relative flux, which depend s on the ion’s 673 
diffusion coefficient and concentration in the pore  solution. The diffusion coefficients of different ions are usually 674 
at the same order of magnitude, as shown in Table 2 . However, their concentrations can span several or ders of 675 
magnitude, which induces wide differences in the re lative fluxes and is responsible for the different migration 676 
behavior of Mg 2+ , Na +, and SO 42- under applied electric fields. In this respect, fo r a reactive-transport process, it is 677 
sometimes acceptable to suppose the same diffusion coefficient for different ionic species, as was don e in 678 
[16,70,71]. Nevertheless, the effect of chemical re actions on the concentration and thus the migration  of ionic 679 
species should be carefully considered. 680 
 681 
4.5 Comparison with real-life situations 682 

=== Page 37 ===
36  683 
This setup simulates both processes when electric c urrent flows into and out of the cement-based mater ials 684 
simultaneously. In contrast, in the case of DC stra y current, these two processes occur separately. Th e electric 685 
current enters the concrete at a certain location, goes through the reinforcement, and then flows out of the concrete 686 
at another location [29]. The ionic exchange betwee n the external environment and cement-based materia ls induced 687 
by the inflow and outflow of electric current can b e represented by the anode area and cathode area in  this setup, 688 
respectively, but the behavior of the reinforcement s, e.g., anodic corrosion or hydrogen evolution, is  not simulated. 689 
Moreover, this paper focused on the chemical and mi neralogical aspects of sulfate attacks and thus the  physical and 690 
microstructural aspects, including expansion and cr acking, were not investigated. During the electric migration 691 
tests, the specimens did not show significant crack ing, which agrees with the focus of this paper but may possibly 692 
differ from the real situation. The test results (F ig. 7) and thermodynamic modeling (Fig. 13a) both i ndicate the 693 
decomposition of ettringite at the late degradation  stage, probably suggesting the absence of expansio n at that stage. 694 
However, thermodynamic modeling predicted an increa sed volume of hydration products near the cathode, which 695 
may yet cause expansion. Based on the results of th is paper, it is difficult to determine whether expa nsion and 696 
cracking will occur under such circumstances. 697 
 698 
The concentration of ions in the external solution will change with time, and this will be the other d ifference 699 
between the test setup and the real-life situation.  Although the concentration of the sulfate solution  theoretically 700 
remains above ~0.34 mol/L due to the 3-day periodic ally refreshment (see section 2.2 and Supplementary  Data), it 701 
seems that the alterations of the ionic strength in  the external sulfate solution have still impact th e products formed 702 
on the surface of the specimens (see section 4.3). Increasing the volume of the external solutions and  shortening the 703 
refreshing cycle can be solutions to this problem. 704 

=== Page 38 ===
37  705 
The test setup used here has been proposed for the purpose of laboratory acceleration tests [39-41]. T he discussion 706 
in section 4.3 demonstrates that the electric migra tion of ionic species near the cathode not only ind uce the ingress 707 
of sulfate, but also cause a neutralization process  in the pore solution and a decalcification process  (see also Table 708 
3). These effects should be considered when interpr eting the mineralogical alterations obtained by suc h test setups, 709 
especially when a) MgSO 4 attack is investigated and the degradation proceed s to the late-stage quickly and b) a 710 
long exposure time is investigated in the case of N a 2SO 4 attack and the degradation may proceed to a later stage 711 
compared with that in this paper. After an exposure  time of 28 d, SO 42- from the cathodic solution had penetrated 712 
through most of the specimen and even influenced th e area that is 5–10 mm deep from the anode, as indi cated by 713 
the distribution of hydration products (Fig. 7 and Fig. 12). Specimens with greater height are thus re commended for 714 
such tests, especially in the case of long duration  (e.g., > 28 d exposure time), in order that the re al penetration 715 
depth of SO 42- can be accurately identified from an uncontaminate d area. 716 
 717 
In addition to the situations mentioned above, we b elieve that the simplified approach for the thermod ynamic 718 
modeling study proposed in this paper can be more b roadly applied in investigating the behavior of cem ent-based 719 
materials under applied electric fields. Future stu dies may involve the use of this approach in accele rated 720 
electrochemical leaching tests [37,38], other types  of chemical attacks, and in concrete technologies involving 721 
electrochemical methods (e.g., chloride extraction,  realkalinization, and electrochemical deposit [32- 34]). 722 
 723 
5 Conclusions 724 
 725 
When an electric current flows out of a Portland ce ment paste (in the cathode area of the specimen), t he electric 726 

=== Page 39 ===
38 migration of ionic species induced the ingress of s ulfate from the external solution. Ettringite forme d at the initial 727 
stage but decomposed to form gypsum at a later stag e. Thermodynamic modeling indicates that the alkali nity of the 728 
pore solution decreased during this process, which is most probably responsible for the decomposition of ettringite. 729 
In addition to the sulfate ingress, decalcification  also occurred in this area, which is characterized  by the 730 
decomposition of portlandite followed by that of C- S-H. When the specimen was exposed to MgSO 4, the sulfate 731 
ingress and decalcification proceeded to a later st age and occurred in a deeper area compared with the  specimen 732 
exposed to Na 2SO 4. 733 
 734 
Near the anode, electric current flows into the cem ent paste, and the electric charges were mainly car ried by the 735 
electric migration of OH - from the pore solution towards the external soluti on. The Ca 2+  originally in the pore 736 
solution migrated towards the inner part of the spe cimen at a much lower rate than that of OH -, and thus the 737 
incorporation of the cations from the external solu tion (Mg 2+  or Na +) was slow. The incorporation of Mg 2+  formed 738 
brucite and M-S-H–like products. Thermodynamic mode ling indicates that this process induced a low Mg 2+  739 
concentration in the pore solution, and thus Mg 2+  would not effectively migrate into the inner part of the specimen. 740 
In contrast, the incorporation of Na + formed Na-rich silica gel, during which the Na + concentration in the pore 741 
solution was much higher. As a result, Na + showed a better capability of migration and can pe netrate through the 742 
cement paste easily. Since both cations and anions can carry electric charges, the different migration  behaviors of 743 
Mg 2+  and Na + are attributed to inducing the different degrees o f sulfate ingress near the cathode. 744 
 745 
A simplified approach based on thermodynamic modeli ng and the ionic transportation equation were newly  746 
proposed to provide insights into the degradation p rocesses of the sulfate attacks that are induced by  electric 747 
migration. In addition to calculating the degradati on phase assemblage, the migration behavior of ioni c species 748 

=== Page 40 ===
39 under electric fields can be represented by the rel ative flux. We believe this approach can be more br oadly applied 749 
to predict the behavior of cement-based materials u nder electric fields. 750

This paper describes simulations of chemical degradation of cementfor different types of rain and soil water at an ambient earth surface temperature (10 °C). Rain and soil water
types were derived using generic equations and measurement of atmospheric boundary conditions
representative for North-Belgium. An up-to-date and consistent thermodynamic model is used to calculatethe geochemical changes during chemical degradation of the concrete. A general pattern of four degradation
stages was simulated with the third stage being the geochemically most complex stage involving reactions
with calcium-silicate hydrates, AFm and AFt phases. Whereas the sequence of the dissolution reactions wasrelatively insensitive to the composition of the percolating water, the duration of the different reactions
depends strongly on the percolating water composition. Major identi ﬁed factors in ﬂuencing the velocity of
cement degradation are the effect of dry deposition and biological activity increasing the partial pressure ofCO
2(g)in the soil air phase (and thus increasing the inorganic carbon content in the percolating water). Soil
weathering processes have only a minor impact, at least for the relatively inert sandy material considered in
this study.

1. Introduction
Cement and concrete are typically not in thermodynamic
equilibrium with the surroundings in which they are located. Because
concrete used in e.g. waste conditioning and surface disposal sites is
not an isolated system, in ﬁltration and movement of solutes from the
surroundings will change the concrete pore water and solid phase
composition and, therefore, the solubility and sorption of contami-
nants (see Wang et al. [1]for an extensive review of sorption values
for radionuclides and some chemotoxic elements as a function of the
cement degradation stage).
Typical chemical degradation reactions are decalci ﬁcation, disso-
lution and leaching of cement components and carbonation (Glasser
et al. [2]), amongst others. These reactions induce a gradual change in
the pore water composition, from typical “young ”concrete pore water
with a pH above 13 to more evolved pore water with a pH lower than
10. Different attempts have been made to simulate the long-term
chemical degradation of concrete [3–7]. In general, at 25 °C four stages
of cement degradation are identi ﬁed depending on the pH and cement
pore water controlling cement phases (pH-values are for 25 °C). Stage
1 has a pH larger than 12.5 with a high concentration of Na and K ions.
Stage 2 has a pH of 12.5 controlled by the dissolution of portlanditewith approximately 20 mm of Ca. Stage 3 starts when all portlandite
has been leached out of the cement and the pH drops from 12.5 to 10.0
when the pore water composition is buffered by different cement
phases including AFt, AFm and calcium-silicate hydrates (C –S–H
phases). The end of this stage is de ﬁned when all these phases are
completely leached out. Stage 4 has a pH lower than 10 with calciteand aggregate minerals present. The pore water composition is then
mainly in ﬂuenced by the composition of the intruding water.
Although the reactions within each stage, are quite independent of
the composition of the intruding water, the duration of the different
stages (expressed in total amount of added water) and the amount of
minerals which dissolves or precipitates per kg of added water
depend strongly on the composition of the in ﬁltrating water.
The assessment of the progression of the long-term chemical
degradation of cement is possible by means of model simulation. The
most straightforward way is using thermodynamic equilibrium
modelling coupled with transport of solution species. Such modelling
approach is able to reproduce the zoning of cement degradation, as is
shown by e.g. Moranville et al. [8]. A more simple approach is to use
only thermodynamic equilibrium modelling with a mass-balance
approach in which, after the equilibrium calculation, the cement-
equilibrated pore water is replaced with a new amount of the external
aggressive water but keeping the changed cement solid phase. Such
type of simulation allows an in-depth analysis of the geochemical
changes in both the pore water and the solid phase.Cement and Concrete Research 40 (2010) 1306 –1313

This paper describes simulations of chemical concrete degradation
using thermodynamic equilibrium modelling combined with mass-
balance approach for different rain and soil water types accounting for
processes like wet deposition, dry deposition, soil biological processes
and soil weathering and release of major cations at ambient surface
temperatures (10 °C) using a consistent thermodynamic model for
cement phases at temperatures different from the standard temper-ature (25 °C). These calculations were done within the framework of
near-surface disposal of low and intermediate-level short-lived radio-
active waste in Belgium, and therefore, atmospheric boundary
conditions relevant for determining rain water and soil water
composition were taken representative for Belgian conditions.
2. Model approach
Chemical degradation of concrete is simulated using mass conser-
vation and thermodynamic equilibrium laws (mass action equations)
starting from 1000 cm
3of concrete at a long-term averaged atmospheric
temperature ( ∼10 °C, representative for Belgium, Jacques and Mallants
[9]). The concrete is equilibrated with a given amount of external water
(not in equilibrium with the concrete phases). After equilibration, the
resulting water is replaced by a new amount of external water whereas
the changed cement solid phase is kept. In this way, the changing
cement pore water and solid phase composition is simulated as function
of cumulative added (external) water. This approach needs (i) a
consistent thermodynamic database (i.e., solubility constants of the
cement minerals are calculated with a single set of aqueous species and
thermodynamic constants) for aqueous species and cement phases for
10 °C, (ii) the initial concrete composition and (iii) the composition of
the external water types.
2.1. Thermodynamic model for cement degradation
A thermodynamic data set for cement minerals was built by
Lothenbach and Winnefeld [10], Lothenbach et al. [11] and Matschei
et al. [12] (CEMDATA07), consistent with the thermodynamic data in
the Nagra/PSI-Thermodynamic Data Base [13]. When used in the
geochemical GEMS-software [14], temperature dependencies of ther-
modynamic parameters are calculated with the embedded SUPCRT code
[15]. The GEMS-software minimizes the Gibbs free energy of the system
subject to a number of constraints (mass-balance conditions, electrical
neutrality). The database can be used in other geochemical codes (e.g.
PHREEQC [16]in which geochemical equilibrium is calculated based on
mass action equations) at 25 °C together with the Nagra/PSI-Thermo-
dynamic Data Base. To be used at other temperatures in PHREEQC,
temperature dependencies of the aqueous species should be exactly the
same as in GEMS, otherwise, the CEMDATA07 database and the Nagra/
PSI database are not consistent. To simulate the chemical degradation
due to leaching at a long-term average of the atmospheric temperature
(taken to be 10 °C in Belgium), the equilibrium constants of all aqueous
species and minerals in the model must be recalculated for this
temperature. The Gibbs free energy for all species was calculated with
GEMS (based on the revised Helgeson –Kirkham –Flowers equations for
aqueous species or on the integration of the heat capacity function Cp(T)
for minerals and gases) and related to the mass action constant KTby:

GEMS-database to a PHREEQC-database, a list of the aqueous species
and minerals in the thermodynamic model and corresponding mass
action constants at 10 °C are given in Jacques [17]. Note that the
solubilities of Na and K in stage 1 were slightly differently treated.
Alkali sulphate salts are very soluble resulting in the high Na and K
concentrations, but sulphate is buffered by the formation of ettringite.Because Na- and K-controlling phases are lacking in the thermody-
namic database, two surrogate phases (Na
2O and K 2O) were de ﬁned
to mimic the average concentrations of Na and K in fresh ordinary
Portland cement (as reported by Brouwers and van Eijk [18]).
2.2. Concrete composition and initial cement hydrates
Calculations are based on a CEM I 42.5 N composition as given in
Lothenbach et al. [11](Table 1 ). The concrete consists of 350 kg CEM I,
1828 kg of different calcareous aggregates and 175 of kg water per m3
of concrete (Jacques et al. [19]). Calculated equilibrium concrete pore
water composition and mineral phase assemblages are given in
Table 2 .
2.3. Water composition
The geochemical degradation of concrete depends on the
composition of the external percolated water. The sensitivity of the
chemical degradation rate of concrete for water composition is
evaluated by doing several simulations with different water types.
Water compositions used in the simulations are given in Table 3 .
Theﬁrst two types of water are so-called rain water types. Type 1 is
deﬁned by assuming that the water in ﬁltrating the concrete has the
same composition as rain water. This type is indicated as Rain water —
“wet only deposition ”and representative values were obtained from a
series of averaged yearly concentrations as measured in the Dutch
‘National Precipitation Chemistry Network ’(as cited in Jacques et al.
[19]). The only biological process taken into account for this type of
water is total nitri ﬁcation of the ammonium. Another rain water variant
(type 2) takes into account the bulk dry deposition in calculating its
chemical composition. In this study, this so-called “Rain water —bulk
deposition ”is represented by long-term (1993 –2002) annual averaged
bulk deposition amounts measured in the open ﬁe l da sr e p o r t e di n
Neirynck et al. [20]. Deposition values reported as keq/ha/year are
converted to mol/kg water using the average annual precipitation
surplus (= precipitation −actual evapotranspiration, [19]).
A second group of water types are those in which the rain water,
prior to contacting the concrete, is ﬂowing through soil layers
resulting in composition changes due to (micro)biological respiration
and soil weathering processes. Soil microbiological respiration
increases the partial pressure of CO 2(g)in the soil gas phase compared

to the partial pressure of CO 2(g)of the atmosphere. The increase in the
partial pressure of CO 2(g)depends on the availability of energy and
water in the plant –soil environment. The model of Brook et al. [21]for
predicting the partial pressure of CO 2(g)in the soil gas phase uses the
yearly actual evapotranspiration as a surrogate for both available
water and energy:
log PCO2ðÞ =−3:47 + 2 :09 1−e−0:00172 ETa/C16/C17
ð3Þ
where PCO2is the partial pressure of CO 2(g)in the soil gas phase (atm)
and ETais the annual actual evapotranspiration (mm). The latter was
calculated for typical weather conditions in North-Belgium using a
37-year long climatological record for a sandy soil covered with grass
(for details, see [9]). Also the second typical soil process (weathering) is
estimated in a generic way using only a limited amount of informa-tion on soil texture and parent material class used to de ﬁne a weathering
rate class [22]. The yearly weathering rate of major cations (Na, K, Ca,
Mg) is calculated as:
BC
w=z500 WRc−0:5 ðÞ expA
281−A
273 + T/C16/C17
ð4Þ
where BCwis the weathering rate of major cations (eq/ha/year), Tis the
average yearly soil temperature (10 °C), WRc is the weathering rate class
(1 for a sandy soil), zis the soil depth (1 m) and A=2600K. The
fractions of the individual cations were based on the average total cation
contents for acid sandy soils reported in De Vries [23] and are ﬁxed at
0.3519, 0.4863, 0.0962 and 0.0653 for Na, K, Ca and Mg, respectively.Three types of soil water were de ﬁned: (i) only accounting for soil
biological respiration processes ( “Soil water —CO2”, type 3) (ii)
accounting for soil biological respiration processes and base cation
weathering, in which the Al concentration is calculated in equilibrium
with the soil mineral gibbsite ( “Soil water —gibbsite ”, type 4), and
(iii) the same as “Soil water —gibbsite ”, but the Al concentration is
obtained from multiplying the base cation weathering rate with afactor of 2, according to [22] (“Soil water —weathering ”, type 5).
Some general assumptions were made in the derivation of the soil
water type with respect to the long-term time scale considered in the
chemical degradation of concrete. Basically, assumptions were made
to apply a static mass-balance approach for calculating the soil
inﬂuence on the composition of the in ﬁltrating water. For example,
ion exchange and sorption processes in the soil are not taken into
account. They are considered as ﬁnite buffering processes because, on
the long term, the cation exchange sites are in equilibrium with the
inﬁltrating soil water composition and the weathering processes.
Consequently, ion exchange and sorption processes will not change
the pore water composition once this equilibrium is established.
Other assumptions are listed in [19].
3. Results and discussion of the simulations
3.1. Cement degradation during leaching with rain water
Fig. 1 shows some simulation results for the “Rain water —wet
deposition only ”. The four major stages of geochemical concrete
degradation are indicated. Stage I and stage II are, respectively,
characterized by high Na and K concentrations (simulated here in
equilibrium with the surrogate alkali oxides, Na
2O and K 2O) and Ca
(simulated in equilibrium with portlandite). The element concentra-
tions are controlled by the different cement phases (except Na and K
in stage 2) and are, consequently, signi ﬁcantly different from the rain
water composition. The ﬁrst stage ends after approximately 0.35 kg of
water per 1000 cm3of concrete was added. The second stage ends
after approximately 72 kg of water per 1000 cm3concrete was added.
The dissolution of portlandite results in an increase in porosity of
about 4.9%.
The third stage is geochemically the most complex stage with a
sequence of mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions with
changing dissolution and precipitation reactions of the C –S–H, AFm
and AFt phases. Its end is de ﬁned by the complete dissolution of the
C–S–H tobermorite-like end member. Within this stage, the solution
composition drastically changes with a decrease in pH to 11.06 and up to
one order of magnitude changes in solute concentrations. A number of
cement phase dissolution and precipitation reactions can be inferredTable 2

from Fig. 1 . These stages end after approximately 1766 kg of water per
1000 cm3concrete was added. Due to the dissolution of the voluminous
AFt and AFm phase, the porosity also increases signi ﬁcantly in stage 3.
In stage 4, OH-hydrotalcite and calcite (both from the cement
phase and from the calcareous aggregates) are present. OH-hydro-
talcite ﬁrst dissolves completely with co-dissolution of calcite needing
approximately 4400 kg of water per 1000 cm3concrete, followed by a
slow dissolution of calcite.
The same sequence of reactions up to stage 3 was simulated for the
“Rain water —bulk deposition ”case ( Fig. 2 a—only the solid phase
composition is shown) but with a faster chemical degradation of
concrete compared to “Rain water —wet deposition only ”. Stage 3
needs 246 kg of water per 1000 cm3less than the “Rain water —bulk
deposition ”. A different reaction sequence is simulated for stage
4: OH-hydrotalcite is ﬁrst converted in CO 3–hydrotalcite with precipi-
tation of Al(OH) 3due to the lower pH of the soil water composition.
3.2. Cement degradation during leaching with soil water
Aﬁrst calculation case with soil water is the one where biological
processes were taken into account by increasing the partial pressure
of CO 2(g) in the soil gas phase to 10−2.3atm (based on Eq. (3)).
Mineralogical changes are shown in Fig. 2 b. A large difference if
compared to the rain water cases is the precipitation of calcite (note
that the precipitation of calcite is not visible due to the logarithmic
scale in Fig. 2 b) in all degradation reactions during stages 1, 2, and 3,
whereas calcite was only formed during the dissolution of the
carbonate-bearing minerals (monocarboaluminate and tricarboalu-
minate) in the cement matrix for the rain water types. The calcite is
formed here by the process of carbonation in which dissolved
inorganic carbon, present as CO 32−at high pH, reacts with free calcium
ions (Ca2+). The latter is provided to the concrete pore water by
dissolution of the Ca-bearing cement phases (e.g., portlandite during
stages 1 and 2). Due to this carbonation, the amount of water needed
to end stage 3 is less compared to the rain water types: 1162 kg of
water per 1000 cm3of concrete compared to 1520 kg of water for the
rain water (type 2).
The last two simulations are those accounting also for weathering
of the soil mineral phases. The main difference with the previous
calculations is the presence of aluminium in the water by assuming
equilibrium with gibbsite (Soil water —gibbsite) or deduced from the
base cation weathering rate (Soil water —weathering). The two
simulations are very similar and only “Soil water —gibbsite ”is
therefore shown in Fig. 2 c. The sequence of reactions in stages 1 to 3 is
identical to the previous simulation (Soil water —CO2) with a slightly
larger amount of water needed to end stage 3. During stage 4, Al(OH) 3
is precipitating during calcite dissolution which results in a slightlysmaller increase in porosity during stage 4 compared to the “Soil
water —CO
2”case.
3.3. Comparison of the cases
Table 4 gives the cumulative amount of water needed per
1000 cm3concrete to end stages 1, 2 and 3. The end of stages 1 and
2 is insensitive to the composition of the in ﬁltrating water, except that
the soil water types are slightly more aggressive. The difference
between the fastest and slowest end of stage 3 is about 540 kg of
water per 1000 cm3of concrete.
The “Rain water —bulk deposition ”water type is more aggressive
compared to the “Rain water —wet only ”water type. Whereas the
composition of the wet deposition is in general more predictable from
factors as distance from the sea and main wind direction, the bulk
deposition prediction is much more dif ﬁcult because it depends on
surface characteristics, vegetation type, local-scale wind direction,
industrial activities in the surroundings (Appelo and Postma [24]). For
example, forests change signi ﬁcantly the composition of the through-fall water by different crown exchange processes. Hansen and Postma
[25]showed that concentrations in aquifers may vary up to a factor 10
depending on the location of the measurement (near the windward
margin of a forest, or inside the forest). In that sense, the impact of dry
deposition on the long-term durability of concrete used e.g. in near-
surface disposal facilities is relatively uncertain.
Increasing the partial pressure of CO 2(g) from atmospheric
conditions ( PCO2=10−3.5atm) to soil conditions accounting for
biological activity ( PCO2=10−2.3atm) reduced the water needed to
end stage 3 by about 350 kg of water per 1000 cm3of concrete (i.e., by
about 20%). Putting a soil cover on top of concrete may thus have
negative effects on the long-term chemical durability of it due to an
increased inorganic carbon content from biological processes. How-
ever, a soil layer may (i) protect the concrete from physical degra-
dation processes as raindrop impact erosion and abrasive erosion
when exposed directly to atmospheric conditions, (ii) buffer freezing
and thawing cycles, (iii) limit the impact of biological agents (roots,
organic acids) and (iv) reduce water percolation by evapotranspira-
tion processes. Note also that for the very long time periods envisaged
in radio-active waste disposal, the effect of a change in climatological
conditions on the biological activity may thus also affect the chemical
concrete durability.
The weathering process, simulated here using a generic major
cation weathering rate, has a small but bene ﬁcial effect on the
chemical durability of the concrete. However, when heavy clay (clay
content larger than 60 weight percentage) is used to cover the
concrete, the major cation weathering rate is signi ﬁcantly higher
resulting in higher major cation concentrations, Al and Si concentra-
tions and pH and a longer durability of the concrete is simulated [19].
The variability in the solution composition is illustrated by
comparing the simulated Ca concentrations for the different water
types in Fig. 3 a. The composition of the in ﬁltrating water is only of
minor importance in stages 1 and 2 and partly in stage 3 where
cement pore water is mainly buffered by the cement phases. After
tricarboaluminate is dissolved, variation between the cases increases
for two reasons: (i) when more and more cement phases are leached,
the concentration of the unbuffered elements are equal to the
concentration in the external water, and (ii) because the rate of
leaching of cement phases is different between the water types, the
composition of the solid phases differs at a given amount ofcumulative water between the water types. Consequently, different
assemblages of cement minerals control the pore water composition.
A similar behaviour is simulated for the other elements with the
exception of elements controlled by the concentration in the
incoming water when the cement hydrates controlling these
elements are depleted (e.g., Na and K).
Fig. 3 b shows the weight percentage of the C –S–H phase as
function of the cumulative amount of water per 1000 cm
3of concrete.
This is of particular interest because the C –S–H phase plays an
important role in the sorption and retardation of contaminants. As
was observed for Ca, the decrease is quite similar between the
different cases as long as monocarboaluminate and tricarboaluminate
are present. When these two cement phases are completely leached
out, variation between the different water types increases.
3.4. Discussion
The calculation approach in which new water is brought in contact
with the evolving concrete matrix simulates basically the chemical
detrimental process of decalci ﬁcation by leaching. Experimental
evidence, mainly based on accelerated leaching experiments (e.g.
Nguyen et al [26], amongst others), showed that decalci ﬁcation
results in an increase of porosity and permeability and a decrease in
mechanical strength [2]. The model calculations presented above
simulate also an increase in porosity during the decalci ﬁcation process
because, in general, cement phases with a high molar volume are1310 D. Jacques et al. / Cement and Concrete Research 40 (2010) 1306 –1313

=== Page 6 ===
replaced by cement phases with a lower molar volume. Veri ﬁcation or
validation of the sequence of dissolution/precipitation reactions are
difﬁcult for real systems under representative (both hydrological and
chemical) conditions for a speci ﬁc region. The main reason is that the
chemical degradation front due to decalci ﬁcation is a rather slowprocess. For example, Yokozeki et al. [27] investigated concrete
samples with ages between 34 and 104 years old and found that the
thickness of the portlandite dissolution front was in most cases up to
30 mm and that the C –S–H dissolution front was limited to a few
millimetres (up to 5 mm). No information on the different minerals

was reported. To the authors' knowledge, such information is also
lacking for concrete structures under conditions similar to the water
types investigated in the title study.
In the presence of carbonate ions, precipitation of calcite and
dissolution of portlandite occur simultaneously. Because the molar
volume of portlandite is smaller than that of calcite, the carbonation
process results in a porosity decrease or clogging [2]and may form a
protective zone near the interface between the concrete and the
aqueous phase. To assess the balance between the leaching/
decalci ﬁcation and the carbonation processes, reactive transport
models are undoubtedly a powerful tool. Glasser et al. [2]gives an
overview of attempts to model these two processes accounting fortransport and diffusion. In many of these attempts, the cement
mineralogy is simpli ﬁed to a few minerals as portlandite and
sometimes the C –S–H phases whereas secondary minerals such the
AFm, AFt and CASH phases are mostly neglected. However, at very
long time scales, which are envisaged in nuclear waste disposal, these
minerals show a complex precipitation/dissolution sequence, as is
demonstrated in the title study. Carbonation, decalci ﬁcation processes
or other chemical detrimental reactions (see [2]) and their relative
importance for a given water composition and ﬂow regime can be
assessed with the thermodynamic database and geochemical models
such as PHREEQC-2 (in PHREEQC, possible transport modes are one-
dimensional advective ﬂow, multi-dimensional diffusion [28–31],
fractured ﬂow[32] or in a variably-saturated porous medium with
HP1 [33,34] or RICH-PHREEQ [35]). Recently, also GEMS was also used
in a reactive transport simulator (Shao et al. [36]).
Changes in the solid phase composition due to geochemical
detrimental reactions will also induce a change in porosity (see Fig. 1 )
and, consequently, in permeability. In addition, chemically-induced
porosity changes may result in mechanical stresses and mechanical-
induced porosity changes. Chemo-mechanical models (e.g., [37,38] )
accounting for chemical –mechanical coupled effects often use phe-
nomenological relations between the calcium content of the solid

phase and the calcium pore water concentration to simulate the
chemical concrete degradation process [39,40] . Simulations as the
ones presented in the title study can be used to calculate the relation
between the solid phase and the pore water calcium content and
derive parameters for a speci ﬁc composition of the cementitious
material or of the intruding pore water.
4. Conclusions
This paper describes the chemical degradation of concrete as a
function of cumulative percolated amount of water for different water
types. The sequence of mineralogical changes in the cement is
relatively insensitive with respect to the water type composition. The
overall description of four chemical degradation stages of concrete
during leaching is encountered in the simulations, with stage 3
concerning the dissolution of AFm, AFt and C –S–H phases the
chemically most complex stage. These cement phases do not dissolve
in a successive sequence, but in a complex way, e.g. transforming ﬁrst
the AFm phase monocarboaluminate in strätlingite, followed by
ettringite dissolution and followed by strätlingite dissolution.
In contrast to the sequence of mineralogical changes, the duration of
the different stages and dissolution reactions –as measured by the
cumulative amount of water needed to end a stage or to completely
dissolve a given cement phase –strongly depends on the water
composition. In that respect, dry deposition and biological soil processes
contribute signi ﬁcantly to the aggressiveness of the percolating water.
Unfortunately, these two processes are relatively uncertain in the
framework of long-term assessment of concrete durability because they
depend, amongst others, on climatological conditions and site-speci ﬁc
surface factors such as vegetation and industries. The approach followed
in this study allows a fast assessment of the impact on the chemical
concrete durability associated with these factors by considering a range
of possible pore water compositions.

以下是客户发的信息：
掺粉煤灰的净浆试件，放入纯水溶液，氯化钠，硫酸钠，硫酸钠+氯化钠的复盐溶液中（两种工况，纯浸泡和施加水压），其产物含量变化。

这几个工况，都是掺入粉煤灰的试件
1.纯水环境下（纯浸泡与施加水压的情况）下产物的含量变化
2.氯化钠环境下（纯浸泡与施加水压的情况）下所有产物的含量变化
3.氯化钠+硫酸钠溶液环境下（纯浸泡与施加水压的情况）下所有产物的含量变化
产物主要包括氢氧化钙，凝胶，钙矾石，F盐，石膏，Ms，未水化熟料等
最后就是对建模过程有个详细的描述报告，用到的模型参数以及怎么建立的，完整的分析最好。

具体需要我这边提供哪些参数？

您做这个模型的时候，水压力打算怎么去实现呢？

我和客户核对的询问客户的信息：我理解的你这个属于水泥基材料水化产物变化的数值模拟建模任务，具体来说，掺粉煤灰的试件在3种侵蚀环境（纯水、氯化钠、氯化钠+硫酸钠）× 2种工况（纯浸泡、加水压）下，模拟各类水化产物（氢氧化钙、凝胶、钙矾石、F盐、石膏等）含量的变化规律，最后出一份完整的建模说明报告（模型原理➕参数➕分析）。6个工况的反应，传输耦合数值模拟 + 分析报告，你看我理解的对不？

客户回复信息：对的，因为我也看了下文献，水压在这怎么实现我有个大概的方向，我怕你的方式和我看到的不太一样，所以想和您确定一下您做这个模型的时候，水压力打算怎么去实现呢？

Below is the message from the client:
For neat paste specimens mixed with fly ash, place them in pure water solution, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and a mixed salt solution of sodium sulfate + sodium chloride (two conditions: immersion only and with applied water pressure), and observe the changes in the contents of the products.
All of these cases are specimens mixed with fly ash:
1. Changes in product contents in a pure water environment (immersion only and with applied water pressure)
2. Changes in the contents of all products in a sodium chloride environment (immersion only and with applied water pressure)
3. Changes in the contents of all products in a sodium chloride + sodium sulfate solution environment (immersion only and with applied water pressure)
The products mainly include calcium hydroxide, gel, ettringite, F salt, gypsum, Ms, unhydrated clinker, etc.
Finally, provide a detailed report describing the modeling process, including the model parameters used and how it was built; a complete analysis is preferred.
Specifically, which parameters do you need me to provide?
When you build this model, how do you plan to implement the water pressure?
My message to the client to confirm the information:
My understanding is that this is a numerical simulation/modeling task for changes in hydration products of cement-based materials. Specifically, under 3 erosive environments (pure water, sodium chloride, sodium chloride + sodium sulfate) × 2 conditions (immersion only, with applied water pressure), you want to simulate the content evolution of various hydration products (calcium hydroxide, gel, ettringite, F salt, gypsum, etc.), and finally produce a complete modeling description report (model principles + parameters + analysis). A coupled reaction–transport numerical simulation for 6 cases + an analysis report—am I understanding this correctly?
Client’s reply:
Yes. Because I also looked at the literature, I have a general idea of how to implement the water pressure here. I’m concerned that your approach might not be the same as what I saw, so I want to confirm with you: when you build this model, how do you plan to implement the water pressure?

________________Newly added information↓
1. Fly ash glass-phase content. (Chemical composition alone is not enough; the pozzolanic reaction kinetics need the mineral phases. If not available, we can only use literature-based values.)
Client’s reply: No, use literature-based values.
2. How long is the simulation duration (28 days? 90 days? 180 days?)
Client’s reply: 60 days of erosion.
3. Erosion temperature (room temperature or constant-temperature chamber, and what temperature?)
Client’s reply: Room temperature, 20°C.
4. Do you have measured XRD/TGA data? If yes, the model can be calibrated; if not, it can still be done.
Client’s reply: Yes—XRD and TG data after 28 days of hydration, i.e., at erosion 0 day.
Client’s reply: Ignore the trace phases.
Glass phase 73%, mullite 15%, quartz 12%.
Client’s reply: Basically, under static soaking it’s a leaching model, gradually replacing the pore solution with the external solution.
Under pressure, the pore-solution renewal rate increases; the pore-solution renewal rate increases; more solution is replaced per unit time, and more ions enter as well.

I’m not sure whether this will work. If there are other approaches that can achieve it, that’s also fine.
